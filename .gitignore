# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Mac OS X: Add '.DS_Store' to your ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore .env files, containing sensitive information
.env*

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Ignore data dumps and 'pending migrations' in the sidelines
/db/data/
/db/pending_migrations/

# Ignore uploads, attachments, and assets
/public/system
/public/assets
assets_manifest.json


# Ignore VCR fixtures. They keep regenerating, probably
# due to a new_episodes strategy. Should fix this.
/spec/fixtures/requests


# Ignore the Dockerfile. If someone is developing and
# commits, this should not be included, because dokku
# and others will try to deploy with the Dockerfile.
