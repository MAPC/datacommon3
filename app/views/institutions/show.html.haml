Since the fall of 2012, MAPC has worked with Lynn to “Build on the Vision” to revitalize its downtown. MAPC engaged residents, business owners, and local government officials to define a vision of Downtown that embraces the cultural diversity of the city, attracts jobs, and provides support for local businesses.
