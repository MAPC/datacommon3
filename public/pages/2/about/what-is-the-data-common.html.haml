%h1 What is the #{@institution} DataCommon?

%p
  The MetroBoston DataCommon is an interactive data portal and online mapping tool that provides a wealth of information about the region’s people, communities and neighborhoods through a wide variety of topics -- from arts and education to the environment and transportation. A resource for all those seeking to understand how the region is changing, it helps residents, stakeholders, planners, city and town officials, educators and journalists explore options and make informed decisions. We invite you to explore its data, community snapshots, and maps, sign up for training and create your own visualizations and reports. Metro Boston Data Common is co-sponsored by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and the Boston Indicators Project at the Boston Foundation.

  Many of the features on this website are powered by WEAVE (Web-based Analysis and Visualization Environment), a web-based open source data visualization software developed by faculty and students at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell in partnership with the Open Indicators Consortium (OIC), whose goal is to transform publically available data into visually compelling and actionable indicators to inform public policy and community-based decision makers. Weave allows users to explore, analyze, visualize and disseminate data online. To learn more about WEAVE, please visit www.oicweave.org.
