%h2 About Data Day

Data Day 2009 received an overwhelming response with over 350 in-person attendees and over 100 participating in the webcast over the course of the day.

Data Day is biennial conference to help communities expand their capacity to use technology and data to advance their goals. At Data Day, nonprofit organizations, civic institutions and municipalities come together to see the latest in technology and tools and learn how other groups are using data to support and advance constructive change. This conference is sponsored by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, Northeastern University, and The Boston Indicators Project. Data Day serves to facilitate learning among participants at all levels of technical proficiency, with opportunities to share accomplishments, frustrations and aspirations. It is structured around a series of "how to" interactive workshops in which people who work with data will explain what they do, explore data sources, and guide participants on gathering and using data.
